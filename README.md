Locator to search nearby business that gives discounts to SF Bicycle Coalition members.

# Inspiration
I learned about Mapbox in a Map Meetup and thought about what I can apply it to. As a SF Bicycle Coaltion member who don't bike too much now because I live at the city's edge area, I don't always remember what businesses are working with the coalition to give discounts to member. That's such a waste! It is always confusing to read the membership site too since I don't know if the store is in the area and when they are open. As a result, I decided to create a location using a mix of web scraping and Mapbox to look for nearby open stores.

# Build Progress
